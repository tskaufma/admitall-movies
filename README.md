# AdmitAll Movie Database Viewer

AdmitAll is a Movie Database view based on AngularJS. To use AdmitAll you need to have a movie collection setup in the [AdmitOne Movie Catalog](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.schmidek.catalogue&hl=en) Android App. AdmitAll uses the JSON file produced by the Backup function in AdmitOne. Copy the backup file and save as TKMovies.json in the root of the repository.
